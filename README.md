- Implemented Logistic Regression (using one-vs-all strategy) to classify handwritten digit images into correct corresponding labels. In particular, built 10 binary-classifiers (one for each class) to distinguish a given class from all other classes.
- Developed multiclass logistic regression classifier and SVM for handwritten digits classification on the MNIST Dataset
